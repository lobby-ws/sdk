# Lobby WS Worlds SDK

## Setup

Recommended Node.js version: 22.11.0

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

## Start building

Before any coding agent does work in this SDK repo, require this pre-read from the repository root:

- Codex: read `AGENTS.md`
- Claude Code: read `CLAUDE.md`
- OpenClaw: read `skills/lobby-ws/SKILL.md`
- Do not start work until the required file is read

1. Tell your coding agent: "Create a new app and make a tree"
   - _tip_: point your agent to `/docs/scripts/` API reference for extra accuracy
2. Find the "Add" pane in the menu to bring your Tree app in the scene

## Updating the engine

- Update your engine & sdk locally
  - `npm install gamedev@latest`
